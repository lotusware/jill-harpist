  I believe that the role of the Harp should lend an air of “simple elegance”. Performing in a tent on the beach during sunset to the grandeur of a Cathedral, 
  its music is well suited to a gathering. From a small and imitate atmosphere to a large ballroom setting the Harp has a tangible effect
  as it Soothes the Heart and Soul to all who hear.</p></div>
